# THE CAREER DIRECT PROGRAM: CODING CLUB HACKATHON 

## Queensborough Community College of CUNY

The Career Direct Program introduced the Coding Club Hackathon in the Spring of 2019 for the first time in order to create a unique opportunity for coders, developers, designers, ideators, and mentors to come together, brainstorm, problem solve, and create innovative solutions to real life challenges. The Goal of the Hackathon was to encourage students to use their creativity, programing languages and collaborate with one another to create a live website that markets their skills.

The scope of the project was to create a website “Helping Students Navigate QCC”. Students had a total of 10 weeks dedicated to the Hackathon and were required to use time outside of the Coding Club to collaborate and complete their project. Students were randomly selected into groups of three with a Team Lead in each group.
